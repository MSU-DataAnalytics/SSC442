# In-Class Activity

You have 80 minutes to complete this activity (as a group). Evaluations will be completed shortly after the class ends, so you must work efficiently.

This activity has two parts -- they will receive equal weight in the evaluation. This uses the `Ames` data, located [here](/Labs/data/ames.csv)

1. We are going to train a simple classifier to explore the characteristics of houses with and without `Fireplaces`. This factor variable encodes the number of fireplaces in a home. **Using either a tree-based method or a KNN-based method**, train a classifier on 50% of the data (aka the training data).
2. Create a confusion matrix for the **other 50% of the data** (aka the test data).
3. Informed by your results above, make one visualization.
