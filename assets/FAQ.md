# Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of frequently asked questions in this course. Throughout the term (and over the coming years) we will add to this document to better guide the class and to--hopefully--avoid confusion. If your question is not addressed below and you believe it would be appropriate for this part of the website, please [email me](mailto:bbushong@msu.edu).

## Teams

> My team sucks; how can I switch teams?

Life is full of small disappointments. While we would love to spend 12 weeks carefully optimizing groups, that would require a collosal amount of effort that would ultimately not yield anything fruitful. You're stuck.

> My team sucks; how can I punish them for their lack of effort.

On this front, we will be more supportive. While you have to put up with your team regardless of their quality, you can indicate that your team members are not carrying their fair share by issuing a **strike**. This processs works as follows:
1. A team member systematically fails to exert effort on collaborative projects (for example, by not showing up for meetings or not communicating, or by simply leeching off others without contributing.)
2. Your frustration reaches a boiling point. You decide this has to stop. You decide to issue a **strike**
3. You send an email with the following information:
    - `Subject line:` [SSC442] Strike against [Last name of Recipient]
    - `Body:` You do **not** need to provide detailed reasoning. However, you must discuss the actions (plural) you took to remedy the situation before sending the strike email.

A strike is a serious matter, and will reduce that team member's grade on joint work by 10\%. If any team-member gets strikes from all other members of his or her team, their grade will be reduced by 50\%.

Strikes are *anonymous* so that you do not need to fear social retaliation. However, they are not anonymous to allow you to issue them without thoughtful consideration. Perhaps the other person has a serious issue that is preventing them from completing work (e.g., a relative passing away). Please be thoughtful in using this remedy and consider it a last resort.

> Do I really need to create a team GitHub repository? I don't like GitHub / programming/ work.

Yes, you need to become familiar with GitHub and you and your team will work in a central repository for both labs and your final project.

This is for two reasons. First, computer scientists spent a huge amount of time coming up with the solutions that are implemented in GitHub (and other flavors of `git`). Their efforts are largely dedicated toward solving a very concrete goal: how can two people edit the same thing at the same time without creating a ton of new issues. While you could use a paid variant of GitHub (e.g., you could all collaborate over the Microsoft Office suite as implemented by the 360 software that MSU provides), you'd ultimately have the following issues:
1. The software doesn't support some file types.
2. The software doesn't autosave versions.[^1] If someone accidentally deletes something, you're in trouble.
3. You have to learn an entirely new system every time you change classes / universities / jobs, because said institute doesn't buy the product you love.[^2]

[^1]: Some products, of course, solve this problem a little bit. For example, Dropbox allows users to share files with ease (of any file type) and saves a (coarse) version history. However, Dropbox does not allow multiple users to work on the same file, and has no way of merging edits together.

[^2]: This logic is also why we utilize only free software in this course. It sucks to get really good at, say, `SAS` (as I did many years ago) only to realize that the software costs about $10000 and many firms are unwilling to spent that. We will try our best to avoid giving you dead-end skills.

> I'm on a smaller-than-normal team. Does this mean that I have to do more work?

Your instructors are able to count and are aware the teams are imbalanced. Evaluations of final projects will take this into account. Your work on labs will be assessed solely according to your responses and (where applicable) the correctness of your answers. That said, labs are designed to be reasonably straightforward. While your final product should reflect the best ability of your team, we do not anticipate that the uneven teams will lead to substantively different outputs.

## Labs

> How do I turn in my lab? I wasn't listening.

Your **team** turns in labs together. You will all recieve the same score (including "0" if you did not turn in the assignment). Your team must have a GitHub repository. This must be open. We will evaluate your project **during the assigned class time** by going to your GitHub and running the relevant code (or, when applicable, opening a document).

> How do we format our labs when we turn them in?

We (very much) prefer that your team turn in the written answers to your homework as a PDF. These should include any figures. Why PDFs? Well, as is a theme in this course, we like file formats that are free, that render on lots of machines (e.g., mobile) and that can compress easily for space saving. PDFs meet this requirement nicely.

To create a PDF, you have a few options. You could use `Word` or a similar program, and then export as a PDF. This is gross and if you do it you're officially not getting a job at Facebook. A better approach would be to use a simple and streamlined word processor like [`Atom`](https://atom.io) or [`Sublime Text`](https://www.sublimetext.com) and then figure out how to export a PDF from there.[^3]

[^3]: Both text editors (and many others) have easy solutions to that question, and it's a good way to learn a little more about a very important part of the production process. As the human in the production system, you should recognize that your value is in the generation of text characters by pressing mechanical keys with fingers. Computers can't (yet) do this. Accordingly, the screen you stare at while you complete this process is important, and you should get to know an editor like it is your best friend. But, you know, also make sure to go outside from time to time.

> How many labs are there?

Five? Six? Certainly more than four and less than seven.

> How long should our answers be?

As long as they need to be. Typically, the question will cue you as to what is required. If something is ambiguous or unclear, use your judgement.

## Software

> My setup for `R` isn't working. How can I fix it?

This is the absolute \#1 question in the course and we have no satisfying answer. Computers have tons of specific details that inform how they execute a given piece of code. We cannot say what random program you installed years ago---and sadly this will, to a great extent, determine how your computer performs. Here's a general strategy to dealing with your problem.

1. Google the error message you get. Scroll around until you find a reasonable solution to your problem (often on pages like StackExchange or GitHub's discussion boards).
2. Annoyingly, the second-best way to fix `R` is often to reinstall `R`. This will fix all but the biggest of issues.
3. Still not working? *Not good, Bob!* You're going to have a longer session ahead of you where you deep-dive some opaque error code or have to wipe more than just your `R` installation.[^4]
4. Come to Office Hours.

[^4]: This brings us to another recurrent point: your computer is your most important tool. You absolutely must ensure that you keep it from getting f\&\$\@ed up and cluttered. If you're working with an older machine (more than 5 years old), consider this the moment that you realize you need to upgrade.

## Misc

> How are grades assigned?

As in the syllabus---which outlines evaluations--- grades are assigned using the "standard" cutoffs. For example, 93\% and up ensures that you earn a 4.0 in the class. Between 87\% and 92\% yields a 3.0; and so on down the scale. We will round grades incredibly in your favor---e.g., a 92.47\% will be rounded to 92.5\% and then rounded to 93\%, yielding a 4.0.[^5]

[^5]: Don't do this in a math class. Seriously, don't.

> What material will be covered on exams?

Exams are conceptual. They will require you to understand the mathematics of the course, but will **not** require you to replicate that mathematics. Instead, you should expect to think carefully about a problem in social science and use your judgement to come up with a reasoned solution.
