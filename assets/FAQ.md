# Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of frequently asked questions in this course. Throughout the term (and over the coming years) I will add to this document to better guide the class. If your question is not addressed below and you believe it would be appropriate for this part of the website, please [email me](mailto:bbushong@msu.edu).

## Teams

> My team sucks; how can I switch teams?

Life is full of small disappointments. While I would love to spend 12 weeks carefully optimizing groups, that would require a collosal amount of effort that would ultimately not yield anything fruitful.

> Do I really need to create a team GitHub repository? I don't like GitHub / programming/ work.

Yes, you need to become familiar with GitHub and you and your team will work in a central repository for both labs and your final project.

This is for two reasons. First, computer scientists spent a huge amount of time coming up with the solutions that are implemented in GitHub (and other flavors of `git`). Their efforts are largely dedicated toward solving a very concrete goal: how can two people edit the same thing at the same time without creating a ton of new issues. While you could use a paid variant of GitHub (e.g., you could all collaborate over the Microsoft Office suite as implemented by the 360 software that MSU provides), you'd ultimately have the following issues:
1. The software doesn't support some file types.
2. The software doesn't autosave versions.[^1] If someone accidentally deletes something, you're in trouble.
3. You have to learn an entirely new system every time you change classes / universities / jobs, because said institute doesn't buy the product you love.[^2]

[^1]: Some products, of course, solve this problem a little bit. For example, Dropbox allows users to share files with ease (of any file type) and saves a (coarse) version history. However, Dropbox does not allow multiple users to work on the same file, and has no way of merging edits together.

[^2]: This logic is also why we utilize only free software in this course. It sucks to get really good at, say, `SAS` (as I did many years ago) only to realize that the software costs about $10000 and many firms are unwilling to spent that. We will try our best to avoid giving you dead-end skills.
